/*
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, 
find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:

    Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
    The array size will not exceed 200.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.


Let us assume dp[i][j] means whether the specific sum j can be gotten from the first i numbers. 
If we can pick such a series of numbers from 0-i whose sum is j, dp[i][j] is true, otherwise it is false.

Base case: dp[0][0] is true; (zero number consists of sum 0 is true)

Transition function: 
For each number, if we don't pick it, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], 
which means if the first i-1 elements has made it to j, dp[i][j] would also make it to j (we can just ignore nums[i]). 
If we pick nums[i]. dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i]], 
which represents that j is composed of the current value nums[i] and the remaining composed of other previous numbers. 
Thus, the transition function is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-nums[i]]
